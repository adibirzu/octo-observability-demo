# Phase 3 Plan 02: Source and Docs Gate Summary

## Verification

- `python3 -m pytest -q tests/test_log_analytics_detection_reliability.py tests/test_log_analytics_attack_assets.py tests/test_observability_asset_contract.py` - passed, 26 tests.
- `python3 -m mkdocs build --strict` - passed.
- `git diff --check` - passed.

## Live Data Status

Live Log Analytics execution against demo was not run in this local GSD
phase. The source gate now validates payload construction and rule/dashboard
consistency without OCI credentials; live query result checks remain an
operator action after saved-search/dashboard import.

## Notes

No commits were created in this Codex session.
