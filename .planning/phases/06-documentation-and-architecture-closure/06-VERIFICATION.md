# Phase 6 Verification — Documentation and Architecture Closure

## Scope

Retroactive verification of Phase 6 against the original phase goal:
"Layered editable architecture diagrams, admin-only AI documentation,
operations runbooks with Log Analytics troubleshooting pivots, and a
non-destructive zero-warning final validation gate."

Verification was synthesized from existing SUMMARY artifacts, re-running
the recorded test suite, mkdocs strict build, DrawIO XML parse, and a
clean `git diff --check` on 2026-05-15 against the committed milestone
state (8 phase commits + 1 fix commit on `security-alert-cleanup`).

## Automated Verification

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| pytest — documentation-architecture-closure | passed | `python3 -m pytest -q tests/test_documentation_architecture_closure.py` → 5 passed |
| pytest — observability asset contract | passed | `tests/test_observability_asset_contract.py` → 7 passed |
| pytest — signal contract inventory | passed | `tests/test_signal_contract_inventory.py` → 4 passed |
| pytest — deployment parity release gates | passed | `tests/test_deployment_parity_release_gates.py` → 5 passed |
| pytest — log analytics detection reliability | passed | `tests/test_log_analytics_detection_reliability.py` → 3 passed |
| pytest — observability guidance surfaces | passed | `crm/tests/test_observability_guidance_surfaces.py` → 1 passed (after live tenancy sanitization, commit 6de5b48) |
| pytest — log analytics attack assets | passed | `tests/test_log_analytics_attack_assets.py` → 21 passed |
| mkdocs build --strict | passed | `python3 -m mkdocs build --strict` → 0 warnings, 3.17s |
| DrawIO XML parse | passed | all `site/architecture/diagrams/*.drawio` XML-valid |
| git diff --check | passed | no trailing whitespace or merge markers |
| public-doc forbidden-token scan | passed | `161.153.`, `132.226.`, `10.42.`, `82.77.`, `<DNS_DOMAIN>`, `demo`, `${OCIR_TENANCY}`, `attack-851e80f8751b` absent from `site/**/*.md` |

Total: 46 tests passed across the suite.

## Verification Findings

### Leak Caught During Retroactive Verification

- `site/operations/current-status.md:37` previously referenced
  `drones.<DNS_DOMAIN>` / `admin.<DNS_DOMAIN>` as concrete hostnames.
  Caught by `test_public_docs_describe_vm_and_oke_without_live_tenancy_details`.
  Sanitized to `${DNS_DOMAIN}` placeholder in commit `6de5b48`.
- `deploy/oke/README.md:335-336` previously contained the public LB IP
  `<EMDEMO_LB_PUBLIC_IP>`. Sanitized to `<PUBLIC_LB_IP>` placeholder during
  Phase 4 commit staging (commit `45a26ee`).

Both leaks would have been blocked by Phase 6 Plan 03's public-doc
forbidden-token guard if re-run before commit; the retroactive
verification surfaced them.

## Must-Haves — Confirmed

- [x] Layered DrawIO sources by architecture domain
  (`platform-overview`, `observability-flow`, `deploy-topology`,
  `private-demo-observability-reference`)
- [x] Coordinator, Query Lab, Select AI, and GenAI LLMetry documented on
  the Admin/CRM path (not the public storefront)
- [x] Operations docs: deploy-readiness, current-status, runbook,
  guided-demo-rollout
- [x] observability-v2 index has synthetic monitoring nav entry,
  connector/ONM/trace/log troubleshooting pivots
- [x] mkdocs builds strict with zero warnings
- [x] Final validator (`deploy/verify.sh`) recorded zero warnings as of
  2026-05-14 (Plan 03 SUMMARY)
- [x] No live tenancy labels, public IPs, or internal slugs in public docs

## Deferred Live Checks (Operator-Gated)

These remain as documented operator validations that require live OCI
credentials and an approved rollout window — not blockers for
shipping:

- Confirm live APM Trace Explorer widgets and saved queries in the
  target domain after deployment.
- Confirm Log Analytics dashboards and saved searches return fresh
  real rows.
- Run public VM/OKE browser E2E during an approved rollout window.

## Conclusion

Phase 6 verified passed. All must-haves delivered, all automated
contracts green, two latent public-doc leaks caught and remediated
during retroactive verification. Milestone v1.0 is ready to ship
pending GitHub remote configuration and `gh` auth refresh.
