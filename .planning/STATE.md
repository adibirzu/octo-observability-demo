# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-14)

**Core value:** Every demo user action must produce inspectable, correlated OCI
observability evidence across browser, application, payment gateway, Java
sidecar, database, logs, traces, metrics, security, and GenAI where relevant.
**Current focus:** All planned phases complete; live OCI validation remains operator-gated.

## Current Position

Phase: 6 of 6 (Documentation and Architecture Closure)
Plan: 3 of 3 complete
Status: Milestone v1.0 shipped — PR #47
Last activity: 2026-05-15 — milestone v1.0 PR

Progress: [##########] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 18
- Average duration: 6 min
- Total execution time: 76 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 4 | 22 min | 6 min |
| 2 | 3 | 18 min | 6 min |
| 3 | 2 | 8 min | 4 min |
| 4 | 3 | 18 min | 6 min |
| 5 | 3 | 18 min | 6 min |
| 6 | 3 | 18 min | 6 min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 6 min, 6 min, 6 min, 6 min, 6 min
- Trend: Stable targeted-plan execution

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- 2026-05-18: Phase 7 added — OKE Autoscaling and Stress Demo
  (HPA + Cluster Autoscaler, admin stress-test UI, APM + Monitoring +
  Log Analytics OKE Monitoring storyline). Reopens scope into a new
  milestone v1.1.

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Recent decisions
affecting current work:

- Use GSD in text mode with inherited Codex model behavior.
- Keep GSD worktree isolation disabled for this runtime.
- Treat VM and OKE as active peer runtimes behind the same public LB.
- Keep OCI Coordinator admin-only and scoped to octo-apm-demo.
- Maintain `.planning/codebase/` as the local brownfield map for future phases.
- Keep the signal contract inventory source-level and dependency-light so it can
  run without live OCI credentials.

- FastAPI `push_log` now pulls request IDs from app request context and avoids
  card-masking trace/span join keys.

- Java stdout events now emit dotted payment/service aliases; support services
  now include `service.instance.id` resource identity.

- APM, Log Analytics, dashboard, and Monitoring source assets now have local
  contract tests and documented validation commands.

- Payment gateway response payloads now expose token-safe component labels for
  wallet gateways, card networks, Java processor, and antifraud verification.

- Java payment sidecar calls propagate request/workflow headers in addition to
  W3C/B3 trace context.

- Login now emits success/failure spans, metrics, structured logs, and audit
  rows; authenticated order audit rows use the authenticated user id.

- Log Analytics saved-search/dashboard/detection-rule apply dry-run is now
  offline-safe and has local tests for rule metric/dimension consistency,
  dashboard payload compilation, and unsupported parameter rejection.

- Helm now deploys the same OKE observability/payment contract as the raw OKE
  manifests, including the Java payment gateway, pod identity,
  `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`, Select AI, and Langfuse hooks.

- `deploy/verify.sh` now initializes Terraform offline before validation,
  avoids Kubernetes API calls for Helm client dry-run, and treats provider
  registry/CDN outages as warnings rather than source failures.

- OCI Coordinator now exposes explicit admin-only OCTO scope guardrails and
  dynamic admin host metadata in responses, spans, and logs.

- Workflow Gateway admin labs now reject public storefront host calls from
  browser/admin-token callers while preserving internal service access.

- Customer login/shop copy avoids backend/internal wording and public docs
  avoid live tenancy labels.

- Shop pytest no longer deletes `server.*` modules during collection; the full
  Shop suite and `deploy/verify.sh` pass without warnings.

- Public DrawIO sources are layered by architecture domain and the diagrams
  README documents layer/flow movement conventions.

- Architecture docs now keep Coordinator, Query Lab, Select AI, and GenAI
  LLMetry on the Admin/CRM path.

- Deploy readiness records the zero-warning local verifier, and Log Analytics
  docs include connector, ONM, trace/log, payment, and GenAI troubleshooting
  pivots.

### Pending Todos

- None for the local source milestone.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Shared demo resources are live; deployment and OCI automation must avoid
  destructive or non-OCTO actions without explicit approval.

- The worktree has pre-existing changes outside `.planning/`; future GSD work
  must preserve unrelated edits.

- Secrets, OCIDs, IPs, wallet paths, and operator notes must stay out of public
  docs and GSD artifacts.

- Public VM+OKE load-balanced E2E was not run during Phase 2; keep it in Phase
  4 deployment parity validation with an approved live rollout window.

- `mvn test` could not be run locally because Maven is not installed.

- Live Log Analytics query execution against demo was not run during Phase 3;
  keep it as an operator validation after import/apply with approved OCI
  credentials.

- Live public VM+OKE round-robin validation was not run during Phase 4; keep it
  as an operator validation during an approved rollout window.

- Live OCI GenAI, Select AI, Langfuse, APM, and Log Analytics confirmation was
  not run during Phase 5; keep it as an operator validation during an approved
  live deployment window.

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
