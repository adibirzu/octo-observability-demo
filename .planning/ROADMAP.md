# Roadmap: OCTO APM Demo

## Overview

This roadmap treats the existing OCTO APM Demo as a live brownfield platform.
The next GSD phases focus on making the implementation and demo deployment a
state-of-the-art observability demo: complete evidence per user action,
consistent VM/OKE/container deployment behavior, reliable dashboards and
detection rules, admin-only GenAI operations, and docs that match reality.

## Phases

- [x] **Phase 1: Signal Contract Hardening** - Audit and normalize MELTS fields,
  spans, logs, metrics, and APM/Log Analytics pivots across all services.
- [x] **Phase 2: Payment and User Journey Insight** - Make checkout, login,
  cart, payment, CRM sync, and DB evidence complete for successful and failed
  flows.
- [x] **Phase 3: Log Analytics Detection Reliability** - Verify saved searches,
  dashboards, parsers, and detection rules against real logs and traces.
- [x] **Phase 4: Deployment Parity and Release Gates** - Align VM, OKE,
  container, Helm, and local-stack deployments with repeatable validation.
- [x] **Phase 5: Admin AI and Secure Operations** - Keep OCI Coordinator and
  GenAI capabilities admin-only, scoped, observable, and safe.
- [x] **Phase 6: Documentation and Architecture Closure** - Update runbooks,
  diagrams, troubleshooting guides, and release documentation from evidence.

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Signal Contract Hardening

**Goal**: Every service emits a consistent observability contract that can be
joined from APM to Log Analytics, Monitoring, and ATP.
**Depends on**: Existing live VM and OKE deployment snapshot.
**Requirements**: OBS-01, OBS-02, OBS-03, OBS-05
**Success Criteria**:
1. Trace IDs, span IDs, request IDs, workflow IDs, order IDs, payment gateway
   IDs, user/session IDs, and service names are present where required.
2. APM saved queries return relevant spans for Shop, Admin, Java, payment,
   GenAI, auth, DB, and service-error flows.
3. Log Analytics parsers use existing fields wherever available.
4. Custom OCI Monitoring metrics use the shared OCTO namespace.
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
**Wave 1**
- [x] 01-01: Create signal contract inventory tests and enforcement docs.

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*
- [x] 01-02: Harden Shop and CRM request/log enrichment.
- [x] 01-03: Harden Java sidecar and support-service telemetry.
- [x] 01-04: Validate APM, Log Analytics, and Monitoring assets.

### Phase 2: Payment and User Journey Insight

**Goal**: A successful or failed purchase can be followed from browser action
through Shop, Java sidecar, simulated payment rails, CRM/Admin, and ATP.
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: JOURNEY-01, JOURNEY-02, JOURNEY-04, PAY-01, PAY-02, PAY-03,
PAY-04
**Success Criteria**:
1. Google Pay, Apple Pay, Visa, and Mastercard simulations expose complete
   token-safe workflow steps.
2. Login, add-to-cart, checkout, gateway, CRM sync, and DB spans appear in a
   single trace or documented correlated traces.
3. Checkout success and Admin order views expose usable APM and Log Analytics
   pivots.
4. Decline, timeout, and controlled error flows generate detection-ready logs.
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Verify and patch payment rail simulation and Java spans.
- [x] 02-02: Verify and patch user, cart, login, order, and CRM sync evidence.
- [x] 02-03: Run local validation gate and defer public VM+OKE route checks to
  Phase 4 deployment validation.

### Phase 3: Log Analytics Detection Reliability

**Goal**: Troubleshooting and threat-hunting assets work from real data, not
only synthetic examples.
**Depends on**: Phase 1 and Phase 2
**Requirements**: OBS-04, SEC-01
**Success Criteria**:
1. Saved searches execute without query-format errors.
2. Dashboards render real app, OKE, payment, security, and database samples.
3. Scheduled detection rules use fields emitted by current parsers.
4. Connector, ONM, and collector health failures have fast troubleshooting
   searches.
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Harden source validation for detection rules, saved searches,
  dashboards, and offline dry-run payload generation.
- [x] 03-02: Run local Log Analytics source and docs validation gates; defer
  live real-log execution to operator validation after import.

### Phase 4: Deployment Parity and Release Gates

**Goal**: VM, OKE, container, Helm, and local-stack paths deploy the same app
contract and can be validated before promotion.
**Depends on**: Phase 1 through Phase 3
**Requirements**: DEPLOY-01, DEPLOY-02, DEPLOY-03, DEPLOY-04
**Success Criteria**:
1. Deployment templates expose the same required observability and secret
   variables.
2. VM and OKE can run behind the same LB without user-facing drift.
3. Release validation covers tests, build, docs, smoke, E2E, APM, and Log
   Analytics checks.
4. Scripts avoid destructive actions and stay scoped to OCTO resources.
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Compare deployment manifests, scripts, Helm values, and VM envs.
- [x] 04-02: Harden release validation and rollback guidance.
- [x] 04-03: Validate current demo VM and OKE runtime after rollout.

### Phase 5: Admin AI and Secure Operations

**Goal**: Admin-only GenAI and operational features are scoped, observable, and
safe for demos.
**Depends on**: Phase 1 and Phase 4
**Requirements**: JOURNEY-03, SEC-02, SEC-03, SEC-04, AI-01, AI-02, AI-03
**Success Criteria**:
1. OCI Coordinator remains inaccessible from the customer shop surface.
2. Admin assistant answers stay scoped to octo-apm-demo resources.
3. LLMetry, Langfuse, APM, and Log Analytics correlate GenAI activity.
4. Customer pages clearly present a fake demo shop without backend internals.
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01: Review Admin AI configuration, auth, scope, and telemetry.
- [x] 05-02: Review customer/admin UX boundaries and security logging.
- [x] 05-03: Validate assistant, DB cleanup, users, and order workflows.

### Phase 6: Documentation and Architecture Closure

**Goal**: Documentation, diagrams, and runbooks match the implementation and
current deployment.
**Depends on**: Phase 1 through Phase 5
**Requirements**: DOC-01, DOC-02, DOC-03
**Success Criteria**:
1. Architecture diagrams are layered, editable, sanitized, and current.
2. VM, OKE, container, and local-stack docs share the same validation story.
3. Troubleshooting docs include APM drilldowns, Log Analytics pivots,
   connector checks, ONM checks, and dashboard checks.
4. `mkdocs build --strict` passes after documentation updates.
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01: Update architecture and deployment docs from verified evidence.
- [x] 06-02: Update troubleshooting and runbook content.
- [x] 06-03: Run docs and release-readiness validation.

## Shipped Milestones

- **v1.1** (shipped 2026-05-19) — scaling-demo: Phase 7 OKE Autoscaling and Stress Demo. SCALE-01..04 satisfied. See [`milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md`](milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md) and [`milestones/v1.1-REQUIREMENTS.md`](milestones/v1.1-REQUIREMENTS.md). Audit: [`v1.1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`](v1.1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md) — PASS.
- **v1.0** (shipped 2026-05-14) — initial observability platform: Phases 1–6 (signal contract → payment journeys → LA detection → deployment parity → admin AI → docs). 18 plans completed. Full archive deferred; current snapshot at [`milestones/v1.0-and-v1.1-REQUIREMENTS-FULL-SNAPSHOT.md`](milestones/v1.0-and-v1.1-REQUIREMENTS-FULL-SNAPSHOT.md).

## Current Milestone: v1.2 — phoenix-build-migration

**Goal:** Cut cold-pull latency on `octo-apm-demo-oke` (us-phoenix-1) by building + serving container images from the same OCI region as the OKE cluster. Eliminate cross-region OCIR transfer without disrupting demo continuity.

**Requirements:** BUILD-01..07 (see [`REQUIREMENTS.md`](REQUIREMENTS.md))

**Phases:** 1 phase (Phase 8)

### Phase 8: Phoenix-Native Build + Registry Migration

**Goal:** Build all 5 octo-apm-demo images on `octo-demo-jumphost-v5` (Phoenix, x86_64), push to `phx.ocir.io/${OCIR_TENANCY}/*`, and repoint all deploy manifests + Helm values to the phx OCIR endpoint. Keep frankfurt as rollback fallback for ≥ 7 days.

**Depends on:** Phase 7 (clean baseline of services on octo-apm-demo-oke + traffic-generator pattern).
**Requirements:** BUILD-01, BUILD-02, BUILD-03, BUILD-04, BUILD-05, BUILD-06, BUILD-07

**Seed brief:** [`PHASE-8-BRIEF.md`](PHASE-8-BRIEF.md) — locked decisions, jumphost identity, NSG path, image set, risk surface.

**Success Criteria:**
1. All 5 phx OCIR repos populated with the latest image set; frankfurt repos retain tags as fallback for ≥ 7 days.
2. Reproducible build pipeline runs on jumphost (Auth Token via stdin, idempotent, runbook in repo).
3. Deploy manifests + Helm default to phx; pre-deploy `grep -c eu-frankfurt-1.ocir.io` returns 0 for octo-apm-demo namespaces.
4. Rolling deploy keeps APM Service Monitoring tile visible for every service throughout cutover (canary order: traffic-gen → java-demo → workflow-gateway → drone-shop → crm-portal).
5. Cold-pull benchmark: phx pull < 25% of frankfurt pull wall-clock.
6. `helm rollback` to a frankfurt-pinned revision exercised in verify-work + documented in runbook.
7. Global CLAUDE.md "Cloud-Based Docker Builds" updated + ADR captured under `docs/adr/`.

**Plans:** 8 plans across 7 waves

Plans:

**Wave 1** (parallelizable — NSG ingress + OCIR auth, no shared files)
- [ ] 08-01: NSG + jumphost reachability (dry-run inventory script, creates `deploy/oke/jumphost-bootstrap.sh`)
- [ ] 08-03: OCIR auth on jumphost (Auth Token via stdin, mode-0600 enforcement, creates `deploy/oke/ocir-login.sh`)

**Wave 2** (extends Wave 1 bootstrap script)
- [ ] 08-02: Jumphost tool bootstrap (docker/oci-cli/git/rsync/jq/helm via dnf, verify-before-install) — depends on 08-01

**Wave 3** (TDD pilot, depends on Wave 1+2)
- [ ] 08-04: Build pipeline pilot — `octo-traffic-generator` (RED tests → GREEN `build-push-one-image.sh` → cold-pull pilot)

**Wave 4** (depends on 08-04 pilot proven)
- [ ] 08-05: Build pipeline rollout — 4 services (`octo-drone-shop`, `octo-apm-java-demo`, `octo-workflow-gateway`, `enterprise-crm-portal`)

**Wave 5** (depends on Wave 4 — all phx repos populated)
- [ ] 08-06: Manifest + Helm repoint — atomic default flip + frankfurt-regression gate in surface tests

**Wave 6** (depends on Wave 5, operator-gated cluster cutover)
- [ ] 08-07: Rolling deploy + APM signal continuity verification (5-service canary, 30s/5min APM poll, >60s gap aborts)

**Wave 7** (depends on Wave 6 verified)
- [ ] 08-08: Documentation + ADR + helm rollback drill + BUILD-05 cold-pull benchmark (first ADR in repo at `docs/adr/0001-phoenix-region-migration.md`)

## Future Candidate Milestones (not yet scoped)

- **v1.3 — infra-hardening (Phase 9 candidate):** Boot volume resize 36→100GB on `octo-apm-demo-oke` workers, daily `crictl` GC cron via privileged DaemonSet, `oci-onm-mgmt-agent` clean-reinstall to surface CPU/memory metrics in OCI Stack Monitoring.
- **v1.4 — application-metric-exposition (Phase 10 candidate):** Per-service Prometheus exposition (Python `prometheus_client`, Java Micrometer + Actuator, Go `prometheus/client_golang`) + mgmt-agent `prometheus-scrape-config.json` populated with kubernetes-sd `role: pod` annotation-based scrape job. Adds `http_requests_total`, `http_request_duration_seconds`, `db_query_duration_seconds`, `payment_workflow_duration_seconds`, `business_orders_total` to Stack Monitoring.
