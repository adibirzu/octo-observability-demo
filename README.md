# OCTO APM Demo — Unified Platform

Unified repository for the OCTO Drone Shop + Enterprise CRM Portal
platform: one `deploy/` tree, one Bill of Materials, one Resource
Manager stack, one unified-VM path. The two services live side-by-side
as independent containers under `shop/` and `crm/` so they keep the
cross-service contract hardened in the upstream repos.

**Docs site**: https://example-org.github.io/octo-apm-demo
**Private Demo target hostnames**: `shop.example.test` (Shop) · `admin.example.test` (Admin/CRM)
**Legacy reference profile hostnames**: `shop.example.test` (Shop) · `crm.example.test` (CRM)
**Status (May 6, 2026)**: the `<OCI_PROFILE>` private Compute deployment is live in compartment `<COMPARTMENT_OCID>` with two private app hosts, a private ATP database using `octoatp_low`, public OCI Load Balancer IP `203.0.113.10`, WAF, APM/RUM, OCI Logging, Cloud Guard Instance Security OSQuery assets, availability monitors, and Log Analytics assets. DNS is handled in the separate external DNS tenancy. The manual LB SSL certificate, HTTPS `443` listener, and host routing for `shop.example.test` and `admin.example.test` must be preserved when promoting app changes. The Log Analytics Service Connector route is quota-gated in this tenancy. Check [`site/operations/current-status.md`](site/operations/current-status.md) before treating any shared environment as E2E-ready; private operator plans are intentionally excluded from the public docs build.

## Private Resource Manager status

[Deploy to Oracle Cloud](https://cloud.oracle.com/resourcemanager/stacks/create?zipUrl=https://github.com/example-org/octo-apm-demo/releases/download/resource-manager-stack/octo-stack.zip)

[Deploy Full Private Compute Stack to Oracle Cloud](https://cloud.oracle.com/resourcemanager/stacks/create?zipUrl=https://github.com/example-org/octo-apm-demo/releases/download/compute-resource-manager-stack-20260504/octo-compute-stack.zip)

This private branch should be deployed by building the Resource Manager zip
locally and uploading it in **OCI Console -> Developer Services -> Resource
Manager -> Stacks -> Create stack -> My configuration**. The previous deploy
badge URLs used placeholder GitHub release assets and currently return HTTP
404, so OCI cannot import them. Publish real private release assets before
re-enabling one-click deploy buttons.

## Private Demo architecture

![Private Demo OCTO APM Demo architecture](site/architecture/diagrams/private-demo-observability-reference.svg)

Editable DrawIO source: [`site/architecture/diagrams/private-demo-observability-reference.drawio`](site/architecture/diagrams/private-demo-observability-reference.drawio).

Resource Manager troubleshooting: the supported Console import route is
`/resourcemanager/stacks/create?zipUrl=...`. A Console URL that lands on
`/stacks/create` is stale and can return `NotAuthorizedOrNotFound(404)` before
the zip import starts. If the route is correct, verify the zip URL returns HTTP
200, the active tenancy/region/compartment context is correct, and the user has
Resource Manager stack create/import and job permissions in the selected
compartment.

## Supported deployment paths — same container images

| Path | Entry point | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **OKE** | `deploy/k8s/oke/{shop,crm}/*.yaml` + `deploy/deploy-{shop,crm}.sh` | Production, HA, rolling updates. First-time rollout auto-runs `envsubst` on manifests. |
| **OKE (Helm, existing cluster)** | `deploy/helm/octo-apm-demo/` | Drop-in for operators who already have OKE + secrets. `helm upgrade --install`, `helm rollback`, one release owns both apps. See [`deploy/helm/octo-apm-demo/README.md`](deploy/helm/octo-apm-demo/README.md). |
| **Bootstrap (unified)** | `deploy/bootstrap.sh` + `deploy/destroy.sh` | End-to-end lifecycle: compartment picker → OCIR → kubeconfig → ATP terraform → seed secrets → build+push → apply manifests → ingress + DNS + TLS + smoke test. See [`deploy/BOOTSTRAP-README.md`](deploy/BOOTSTRAP-README.md). |
| **Two-instance Compute** | `deploy/compute/` | Production demo without Kubernetes: public LB/WAF, private Shop and CRM Compute instances, private ATP, Podman by default, OCI APM, Logging, Log Analytics pipelines, and Stack Monitoring Standard. |
| **OCI Resource Manager stack** | `deploy/resource-manager/` | Console bootstrap of APM + RUM + LA + WAF. Build and upload the stack zip manually on this private branch unless a real private release asset exists. |
| **Unified single VM** | `deploy/vm/docker-compose-unified.yml` | Demos, workshops, air-gapped — both services on one Compute instance |
| **local-stack** | `deploy/local-stack/docker-compose.test.yml` | Hermetic regression — Playwright + k6 + CI without OCI credentials. NOT for prod. |

Full matrix: [site/getting-started/deployment-options.md](site/getting-started/deployment-options.md). Observability wiring for a fresh tenancy: [deploy/OBSERVABILITY-BOOTSTRAP.md](deploy/OBSERVABILITY-BOOTSTRAP.md).

## Cross-service integration contract

Both services publish the same contract at `GET /api/integrations/schema`.

| Concern | Value |
|---|---|
| Canonical shop URL env | `SERVICE_SHOP_URL` (legacy aliases: `OCTO_DRONE_SHOP_URL`, `MUSHOP_CLOUDNATIVE_URL`) |
| Canonical CRM URL env | `SERVICE_CRM_URL` (legacy alias: `ENTERPRISE_CRM_URL`) |
| Shared auth header | `X-Internal-Service-Key: $INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY` |
| Idempotency fields on order POST | `source_system`, `source_order_id`, `idempotency_token` (UUID5) |

## Deployment Bill of Materials

Full list of required resources, secrets, CLIs, and images in
**[deploy/BOM.md](deploy/BOM.md)**. `pre-flight-check.sh`,
`init-tenancy.sh`, and the Resource Manager schema all validate against
it.

## Quick start — single VM (fastest path)

```bash
# 1. SSH onto a fresh OCI Compute VM (Oracle Linux 9 / Ubuntu 24.04)
sudo dnf install -y git curl unzip                  # or apt-get

# 2. Clone + configure
git clone https://github.com/example-org/octo-apm-demo.git /opt/octo
cd /opt/octo/deploy/vm
cp .env.template .env
${EDITOR:-vi} .env                                   # set DNS_DOMAIN=example.tld, OCIR, ATP, keys

# 3. Unzip the ATP wallet
unzip /path/to/Wallet_<DB>.zip -d wallet

# 4. TLS certs (bundled domains: shop.$DNS + crm.$DNS)
sudo certbot certonly --standalone \
  -d shop.${DNS_DOMAIN} -d crm.${DNS_DOMAIN}
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/shop.${DNS_DOMAIN}/*.pem   nginx/tls/shop/
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/crm.${DNS_DOMAIN}/*.pem nginx/tls/crm/

# 5. Launch
sudo ./install.sh
```

Validate:

```bash
curl -s https://shop.${DNS_DOMAIN}/ready   | jq
curl -s https://crm.${DNS_DOMAIN}/ready | jq
curl -s https://shop.${DNS_DOMAIN}/api/integrations/schema   | jq .info.title
curl -s https://crm.${DNS_DOMAIN}/api/integrations/schema | jq .info.title
```

Both `/ready` must show `database.reachable=true`; both `/api/integrations/schema`
must return an OpenAPI doc with `InternalServiceKey` in
`components.securitySchemes`.

## Subtree sources

| Path | Source repo | Subtree command |
|---|---|---|
| `shop/` | `github.com/example-org/octo-drone-shop` | `git subtree pull --prefix=shop https://github.com/example-org/octo-drone-shop.git main` |
| `crm/`  | `github.com/example-org/enterprise-crm-portal` | `git subtree pull --prefix=crm  https://github.com/example-org/enterprise-crm-portal.git main` |

Either subtree can be pulled to grab upstream fixes without disturbing
the other service. The upstream repos remain the per-service source of
truth for app-layer changes; this repo owns the unified deploy + docs
surface.
