# Log Analytics dashboards

Artifacts live in `deploy/oci/log_analytics/`.

The private Compute stack can create the OCI Logging log group, app/OS/
container/WAF logs, Log Analytics log group, and Service Connector Hub
routes when the required IAM, agent, and connector toggles are enabled.
Parser, source, saved-search, and dashboard asset upload remains an
operator step after the connectors are active.

## Compute log feeds

## Private Demo attack lab ingestion

The admin **Attack Lab** button emits app logs with `security.attack.id`
and `oracleApmTraceId`. Cloud Guard ad-hoc OSQuery results can be pulled
into the same OCI custom log so Service Connector Hub can route them to
Log Analytics with the same parser contract:

```bash
DRY_RUN=false ATTACK_ID=<attack-id> ADHOC_QUERY_ID=<adhoc-query-ocid> \
OCI_CLI_PROFILE=<OCI_PROFILE> \
COMPARTMENT_ID=<COMPARTMENT_OCID> \
OCI_LOG_ID=<custom-log-ocid> \
./deploy/oci/export_osquery_results_to_logging.sh
```

## Apply

Terraform does not currently bind a Log Analytics source name on the
Service Connector Hub `loggingAnalytics` target. Register or validate the
LA source/parser mapping after the connector exists.

```bash
OCI_CLI_PROFILE=<OCI_PROFILE> \
COMPARTMENT_ID=<COMPARTMENT_OCID> \
OCI_LOG_GROUP_ID=<OCI_LOG_GROUP_OCID> \
LA_LOG_GROUP_ID=<LA_LOG_GROUP_OCID> \
./deploy/oci/ensure_log_analytics_connectors.sh
```

In the current private demo tenancy the helper discovers the requested OCTO logs but
does not create a connector because `service-connector-count` availability
is `0`. It intentionally avoids changing existing shared connectors. The
default connector list now includes the app, stdout, OS, security, chaos,
WAF, Cloud Guard raw, and Cloud Guard query result logs:

```text
octo-app
<DEPLOYMENT_PREFIX>-app-stdout
<DEPLOYMENT_PREFIX>-os
octo-security
octo-chaos-audit
<DEPLOYMENT_PREFIX>-waf
<DEPLOYMENT_PREFIX>-cloudguard-raw
<DEPLOYMENT_PREFIX>-cloudguard-query-results
```

The OCI CLI command surface for Log Analytics content is:

- parser create/update: `oci log-analytics parser upsert-parser`
- source create/update: `oci log-analytics source upsert-source`
- exported custom content import: `oci log-analytics content-import import-custom-content`
- query smoke test: `oci log-analytics query search`

Recommended enhancement: add an idempotent
`deploy/oci/apply_log_analytics_assets.sh` helper that converts these repo
descriptors into the current OCI CLI upsert/import payloads, registers the
source/parser mapping, imports dashboards or saved searches, and then runs
a trace-id query smoke test for fresh Shop and CRM records.
