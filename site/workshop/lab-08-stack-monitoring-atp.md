# Lab 08 — Stack Monitoring + ATP health

## Objective

See the Autonomous Database in OCI Stack Monitoring as a unified
"resource" alongside the application pods, and use it to investigate
a database health concern that started as an APM symptom.

## Time budget

40 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- Lab 03.
- ATP onboarded as a Stack Monitoring `MonitoredResource`
  (`./deploy/oci/ensure_stack_monitoring.sh DRY_RUN=false`).

## Steps

### 1. Find the ATP in Stack Monitoring

Console → Observability & Management → **Stack Monitoring → Monitored
Resources**.

Filter Type = `Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing`. You should
see `octo-atp` listed. Click it.

The resource page shows:

- **Health** — overall green/yellow/red.
- **Capacity** — CPU, storage, sessions, transactions per second.
- **Alarms** — anything currently firing on this resource.
- **Topology** — the graph of related resources (pods, services).

### 2. Read the topology

The shop + CRM pods point at this ATP. Stack Monitoring infers the
relationship from the OCID references in the pod env, so the topology
graph **already shows** drone-shop and crm-portal as dependents — no
manual configuration.

This is the value: at incident time, click the ATP, see what depends
on it, and prioritize the broadcast accordingly.

### 3. Trigger a session-pressure event

Run a high-concurrency burst against the shop:

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 50); do
    (curl -sS https://shop.example.tld/api/products?heavy=true > /dev/null) &
done
wait
```

Within 60-90 s, the **Sessions** chart on the ATP resource page should
show a spike.

### 4. Drill from Stack Monitoring to OPSI

On the ATP page, click **Operations Insights → Open**. OPSI shows
the same session timeline but with longer history and richer SQL
breakdowns:

- Top sessions by elapsed time.
- Top SQL statements (correlate with Lab 03's `SQL_ID`).
- Wait class breakdown (`User I/O`, `CPU`, `Concurrency`, etc.).

### 5. Cross-reference with APM

The session pressure should also be visible in APM:

- Service Topology shows `octo-drone-shop → ATP` with a thicker edge
  than usual.
- Trace Explorer for the burst window shows many parallel traces, all
  spending most of their time in the SQL span.

### 6. (Optional) Configure an alarm

Stack Monitoring resources expose their own metric namespace
(`oracle_oci_database`). Create an alarm:

```bash
oci monitoring alarm create \
    --compartment-id "$OCI_COMPARTMENT_ID" \
    --display-name "octo-atp-sessions-high-lab08" \
    --metric-compartment-id "$OCI_COMPARTMENT_ID" \
    --namespace "oracle_oci_database" \
    --query-text "Sessions[5m].max() > 80" \
    --severity "WARNING" \
    --body "ATP session count climbing — check Stack Monitoring topology for which pods are pressuring the DB." \
    --destinations "[\"$NOTIFICATIONS_TOPIC_OCID\"]" \
    --is-enabled true
```

Now session bursts page on-call automatically.

## Verify

```bash
./tools/workshop/verify-08.sh
```

Expected:

```
✓ ATP MonitoredResource 'octo-atp' exists in Stack Monitoring
✓ Stack Monitoring health is reachable
✓ topology shows ≥ 1 dependent resource (shop or crm pod)
PASS — Lab 08 complete
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `octo-atp` not in Monitored Resources | Onboarding script not run | `DRY_RUN=false ./deploy/oci/ensure_stack_monitoring.sh` |
| Topology graph empty | Pods don't expose ATP OCID in env | Pods need `OCI_ATP_OCID` env var; some operators leave it implicit and discovery doesn't fire |
| OPSI panel says "No data" | OPSI not enabled on the ATP | Console → ATP → Tools → Operations Insights → Enable |
