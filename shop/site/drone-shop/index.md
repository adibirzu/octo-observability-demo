## Live Instance

| URL | Status |

## Current Boundary

- The shop is intentionally **not** the place for catalog or storefront administration.
- Operators manage products, stock, and shop metadata in the CRM.
- The shop renders the synchronized catalog as a customer-facing read model and remains focused on browse, cart, checkout, and shipping flows.

- [Modules](modules.md) — All 13 modules and their endpoints
- [Checkout Flow](checkout.md) — Order lifecycle from cart to shipment
